/*
 Core Data theme:
 1) First you need to create a context to view permanent storage
 2) If you want to add data, you need to create an 'empty row' for the entity of interest
 3) If you want to restore, update, and/or remove data, you must fetch the results using the context, manipulate them as desired, and then commit the changes to the context
 4) Optional: Use predicates to tailor the fetched results
